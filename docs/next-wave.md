1. instead of fixed rewards to the validators, we can have a dynamic reward system based on the amount of work done by the validators

2. check out Polygons Proof of Stake might be useful here 

3. optimize the process for faster responses

4. add a feature for the users to add their api into our platform ( may not be feasible )

5. we will add a price model also, where the user will have to pay the price before trying this service ( this may be complext to keep this in mind )

6. give the workers option like they can choose which request they want to take up like if they want to take a more rewarding job or a less rewarding job etc etc, many features can be added research more
